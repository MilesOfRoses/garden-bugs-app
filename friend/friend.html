	<h1>"Friend" Bugs</h1>
	<h2>Identify your beneficial insect</h2>

	<p>There are two types of beneficial insects.<br> 
	One type are predators that feed on pests. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The other type are polinators that assist the reproduction cycle of your plants.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The easiest way to tell the difference between these types is to watch them for a while to see what they like to eat.</p>
	<br>
