description: Blister beetles are a common field and garden pest best known for the welt-raising secretion they release when injured or crushed. The secretion contains a blistering agent known as catharidin, a substance used to treat the lesions caused by pox virus. Catharidin is so effective at destroying tissue that itâ€™s used in wart removal products. Catharidin is toxic if swallowed. It persists in dead beetles long after the hay they infested has been dried and baled. Horses are particularly susceptible to the poisoning. Depending on the type of beetle, as little as four to six grams of dead insects can be lethal. Humans who ingest the pest can expect severe damage to the urinary tract and gastrointestinal lining. Keep an eye on children who put things in their mouth if blister beetles may be present. In addition to the threat presented by its toxicity, the beetle does damage to both garden and commercial plants, consuming a variety of leaf crops, plant blossoms, landscape flowers and hay crops.
