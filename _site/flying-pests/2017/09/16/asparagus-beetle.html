<p>Both asparagus beetle adults are Â¼-inch long with oval-shaped bodies and moderate length antennae. The common asparagus beetle adult is bluish-black with six cream colored spots on its back (Fig. 1), while adult spotted asparagus beetles are reddish-orange with twelve black spots (Fig. 2). Spotted asparagus beetles should not be confused with beneficial lady beetles. Lady beetle adults have broadly oval to nearly rounded, dome-shaped bodies with a varying number of spots. They also have heads that are partly to completely concealed when viewed from above, and short antennae. The larvae of both species are slug-like with visible heads and legs. Common asparagus beetle larvae are light gray with a black head (Fig. 3), while spotted asparagus beetle larvae are orange.</p>
