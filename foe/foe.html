	<p>Anything that eats your crop is a "pest". There are two general types of pest insects.</p>
	<br> 
	<p>One type are flying pests that can land directly on your plant. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The other type are crawling pests that must climb up your plant.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Flying pests must be delt with in different ways than crawling ones.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The easiest way to tell the difference between these types is to look for any wings.</p>
